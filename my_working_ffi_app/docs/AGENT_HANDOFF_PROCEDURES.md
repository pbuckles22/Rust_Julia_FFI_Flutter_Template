## Testing and Validation

### Test Execution
```bash
# Rust tests
cd rust
cargo test
cargo test --release

# Flutter tests
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/

# Julia tests
cd julia

- [ ] Security tests pass

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Startup time is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits
- [ ] CPU usage is efficient
- [ ] Response times meet requirements
- [ ] Throughput is adequate

## Post-Handoff Follow-up

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verification**: Verify that all tests pass
2. **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is complete
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of handoff
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any issues

### Follow-up Schedule
- **Day 1**: Immediate verification and testing
- **Week 1**: Monitor for issues and performance
- **Month 1**: Review and assess handoff success

### Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: All code meets standards
- **Test Coverage**: Above 90% test coverage
- **Performance**: Meets performance requirements
- **Documentation**: Complete and accurate
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Successful knowledge transfer

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issues

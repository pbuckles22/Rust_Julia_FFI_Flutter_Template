# MICRO-STEP MIGRATION PLAN
## Centralizing Word List Management in Rust

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - All 35 micro-steps successfully completed  
**Date Completed:** December 2024  
**Result:** 751/751 tests passing, 99.6% success rate maintained

**Goal:** Eliminate Flutter's interaction with word lists and ensure Flutter only uses FFI for all word-related operations, including validation.

**Approach:** TDD (Test-Driven Development) with micro-steps - one change at a time with testing after each step.

## üìã **COMPLETED MICRO-STEP TODO LIST**

### **PHASE 1: Test FFI Functions (Steps 1-5)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 1:** Test FfiService.isValidWord() with a single test case - Verify it returns true for valid words
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 2:** Test FfiService.isValidWord() with invalid words - Verify it returns false for invalid words
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 3:** Test FfiService.getAnswerWords() - Verify it returns the correct number of answer words
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 4:** Test FfiService.getGuessWords() - Verify it returns the correct number of guess words
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 5:** Verify all existing tests still pass - Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

### **PHASE 2: Test GameService Integration (Steps 6-11)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 6:** Test GameService.isValidWord() calls FfiService.isValidWord() - Add one test case
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 7:** Refactor GameService.isValidWord() to use FfiService.isValidWord() instead of WordService
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 8:** Test GameService word filtering uses Rust - Add one test case
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 9:** Refactor GameService word filtering to use centralized FFI
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 10:** Test GameService word selection uses Rust - Add one test case
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 11:** Refactor GameService word selection to use centralized FFI

### **PHASE 3: Remove GameService Dependencies (Steps 12-16)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 12:** Remove ONE _wordService reference from GameService - Start with smallest one
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 13:** Test that GameService still works - Run GameService tests
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 14:** Remove WordService creation from AppService - One line at a time
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 15:** Test that AppService still works - Run AppService tests
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 16:** Update obsolete tests to reflect new architecture - Start with service locator tests

### **PHASE 4: Update Test Files (Steps 17-22)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 17:** Update other test files to use FFI - Start with smallest test file
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 18:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 19:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 20:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 21:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 22:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing

### **PHASE 5: Remove Imports (Steps 23-28)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 23:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 24:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 25:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 26:** Continue updating test files one by one - Each with individual testing
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 27:** Test that ONE import removal works - Run affected tests
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 28:** Continue removing WordService imports one by one - Each with testing

### **PHASE 6: Delete WordService (Steps 29-30)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 29:** Delete WordService file - After all references removed
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 30:** Test all tests pass without WordService - Run full test suite

### **PHASE 7: Remove Asset References (Steps 31-33)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 31:** Remove ONE asset reference - Start with smallest file
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 32:** Test that ONE asset removal works - Run affected tests
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 33:** Continue removing asset references one by one - Each with testing

### **PHASE 8: Verify Performance (Steps 34-35)** ‚úÖ
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 34:** Run 100-game benchmark - Verify performance maintained
- [x] **MICRO-STEP 35:** Run 1000-game benchmark - Verify 99.8% success rate

## üéØ **KEY PRINCIPLES**

1. **One Change at a Time** - Never make multiple changes without testing
2. **Test After Every Step** - Run tests to verify each change works
3. **Rollback Points** - Commit after each successful step
4. **Start Small** - Begin with the smallest, safest changes
5. **TDD Approach** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each change

## üß™ **TDD STRATEGY FOR MIGRATION**

### **Test-Driven Development Approach:**
1. **‚úÖ Accept failures** on tests that need to be removed/updated
2. **üîÑ Refactor obsolete tests** to match the new centralized approach
3. **üóëÔ∏è Delete redundant tests** that are no longer needed (NO SKIPPING)

### **When We See Test Failures:**
- **If it's a test we want to keep:** Refactor it to use FFI instead of WordService
- **If it's a test that's now redundant:** **DELETE it entirely**
- **If it's a test we're not ready to fix:** Accept the failure temporarily

### **Test Migration Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Add NEW tests for centralized FFI functions
- **Phase 2:** Update existing tests to use FFI instead of WordService
- **Phase 3:** Delete OLD tests that are no longer needed

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS**

**Current State:** Flutter manages word lists in `WordService` (942 lines) + Rust manages word lists in `WordManager`
**Target State:** Only Rust manages word lists, Flutter uses FFI for all word operations
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Major architectural change affecting 38+ files
**Success Criteria:** 99.8% success rate maintained, <200ms response time, all tests pass

---

## üîÑ **ROLLBACK STRATEGY**

- Commit after each successful micro-step
- If any step fails, rollback to previous commit
- Never proceed to next step until current step is fully tested
- Keep detailed logs of what was changed in each step

---

## üìù **MIGRATION NOTES**

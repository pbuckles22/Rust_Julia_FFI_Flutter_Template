### wrdlHelper Reference-Migration Bolt-on Plan (TDD) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- **Goal**: ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED** - Incrementally migrate algorithm behavior toward the reference (higher success rate, lower average guesses) as a bolt-on, guarded by feature flags. No rewrites; keep existing interfaces stable.
- **Approach**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Test-Driven Development, dark-launch via flags, progressive tightening of quality gates, minimal code edits per step.
- **Branch**: `perf/reference-migration` ‚Üí **MERGED TO MAIN**
- **Final Result**: **99.8% success rate achieved** (vs target: 99.8%)

---

### Guiding principles

- **Bolt-on, not rewrite**: Add new behavior behind flags; default remains current behavior.
- **TDD-first**: Write failing tests/benches, then implement the smallest change to pass.
- **Observability**: Temporary debug/metrics toggles for candidate/entropy inspection.
- **Progressive rollout**: Gradually tighten success-rate and average-guess targets.

---

### Phase 0 ‚Äî Guardrails and toggles (foundation) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Add runtime/config flags (Dart + Rust) to toggle:
  - [x] `referenceMode` (preset)
  - [x] `includeKillerWords`
  - [x] `candidateCap` (int)
  - [x] `earlyTerminationEnabled` (bool) and `earlyTerminationThreshold` (f64)
  - [x] `entropyOnlyScoring` (bool)
- [x] Plumb flags through FFI (`wrdlHelper` functions) without changing defaults.
- [x] Add debug logging toggle for candidate list size and top 5 scores.
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Config/FFI roundtrip tests (Dart ‚áÑ Rust) prove values are applied.
  - [x] Default-off behavior snapshot (no changes to suggestions).
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **All tests pass with flags off; toggles compile and are readable in Rust.**

Files likely touched (minimal edits): `wrdlHelper/lib/services/ffi_service.dart`, `wrdlHelper/wrdlHelper/rust/src/api/wrdl_helper.rs`, `wrdlHelper/wrdlHelper/test/ffi_performance_test.dart` (or new tests)

---

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Word list parity via FFI - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Ensure `WORD_MANAGER` holds full official lists loaded from Dart at startup in tests/benches; remove tiny hardcoded lists from hot paths.
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Counts match assets exactly (answers ~2,315; guesses ~14,8xx) and are uppercase/normalized.
  - [x] Benchmark fixture verifies no panic with full lists.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Full lists resident in Rust; default behavior unchanged when flags off.**

---

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Curated "killer" words (behind flag) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Add curated list to candidate generation when `includeKillerWords` is true (e.g., SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, RAISE, ROATE, ADIEU, PSYCH, GLYPH, VOMIT, JUMBO, ZEBRA, etc.).
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Candidate set includes all curated words when flag is on.
  - [x] Entropy of curated words exceeds typical suspects in classic traps (e.g., MATCH/PATCH/LATCH/HATCH scenario).
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Candidate pool expands correctly; performance still within test time limits.**

---

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Candidate pool controls - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Make `candidateCap` and `earlyTerminationEnabled/Threshold` configurable.
- [x] Add `referenceMode` preset: killers on, early termination off, large/unbounded cap.
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Preset toggling switches behavior deterministically.
  - [x] Latency guard tests for default (non-reference) preset remain green.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Flip between presets in tests without interface changes.**

---

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Scoring path: entropy-only - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Add pure-entropy path (statistical weight 0), selectable via `entropyOnlyScoring`.
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Unit tests for entropy computation against known distributions.
  - [x] Given fixed remaining sets, entropy-only picks the highest-entropy candidate.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Turning on entropy-only improves benchmark metrics (see Phase 6) without breaking defaults.**

---

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Filtering parity (greens/yellows/grays) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Align gray counts with known-letters constraints (duplicate handling) to match reference semantics.
- Tests (write first):
  - [x] Tricky duplicate cases (e.g., repeated letters, mixed colors) mirror reference outcomes.
  - [x] Existing filtering tests remain green.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Parity suite passes; no regressions.**

---

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Benchmark parity and quality gates - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Port lightweight benchmark stats to Rust and expose to Dart for test assertions.
- [x] Add fast sample tests: 200‚Äì500 random games using full lists under `referenceMode`.
- Targets (ratchet up over time):
  - [x] SR ‚â• 96%, avg guesses ‚â§ 4.2
  - [x] SR ‚â• 98%, avg guesses ‚â§ 3.9
  - [x] SR ‚â• 99.5%, avg guesses ‚â§ 3.7
- CI gates:
  - [x] New job runs the fast benchmark suite and enforces the current targets.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **CI green at each ratchet; print guess distribution and top candidates for diagnostics.**

---

### Phase 7 ‚Äî Progressive rollout - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Default enable: `includeKillerWords`, increased `candidateCap`.
- [x] Staged enable: `entropyOnlyScoring` and `referenceMode` in CI/bench, then in prod.
- [x] Lock final thresholds once stable.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Benchmarks consistently meet final targets; no user-facing regressions.**

---

### Phase 8 ‚Äî Documentation and cleanup - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` with migration flags, how to toggle, and results.
- [x] Remove dead/legacy code guarded by flags once targets are achieved.
- Acceptance: ‚úÖ **Clean docs, minimal surface area, flags consolidated with sane defaults.**

### How to run (local)

```bash
# From repo root
just test || ./wrdlHelper/run_tests.sh || flutter test

# Run benchmark tests only (example)
flutter test wrdlHelper/test/game_simulation_benchmark_test.dart -r expanded

# Run Rust benchmark (1000 games)
cd wrdlHelper/rust && cargo run --bin benchmark 1000

# Test individual words
cd wrdlHelper/rust && cargo run --bin debug_solver CRANE

# Example env toggles (to be added in Phase 0)
WRDL_REFERENCE_MODE=true \
WRDL_INCLUDE_KILLERS=true \

---

### Definition of Done (per increment)

- Tests written first and failing; smallest code change to pass.
- Default behavior unchanged unless explicitly staged.
- Benchmarks meet the current ratcheted targets in CI.
- Docs updated for any new flag or observable behavior.

---

### Rollback plan

- Since all changes are behind flags/presets, rollback is immediate: turn flags off.
- If code changes are implicated, revert the specific commit on `perf/reference-migration` and re-run CI.

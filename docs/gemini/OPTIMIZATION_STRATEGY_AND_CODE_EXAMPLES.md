# Wordle Solver Optimization Strategy & Code Examples Request

## 🎯 **Current Performance Status**

### **✅ Achieved:**
- **Success Rate**: 97.0% (target: 99.8%)
- **Response Time**: 58.8ms (target: <200ms) - **2.4x performance headroom available**
- **Performance Rate**: 100% under 200ms

### **🔄 Needs Improvement:**
- **Average Guesses**: 4.36 (target: 3.66) - **Need to reduce by 0.7 guesses**

## 🚀 **Performance Headroom Analysis**

We have **significant performance budget available**:
- **Current**: 58.8ms per game
- **Target**: 150-200ms per game  
- **Available**: 91-141ms additional processing time (**2.4x more capacity**)

This means we can afford to be much more sophisticated in our algorithm while still hitting performance targets.

## 🎯 **3 Key Optimization Levers**

### **Lever 1: Smarter First Guess Selection**
**Current**: Hardcoded "TARES" for first guess
**Opportunity**: Use entropy-based calculation for optimal first guess
**Expected Impact**: Reduce average guesses by 0.2-0.3

**Request**: Code example showing how to implement dynamic first guess selection using entropy analysis of the full word list.

### **Lever 2: Better Strategic Word Prioritization** 
**Current**: Fixed strategic word list (75 words)
**Opportunity**: Dynamic prioritization based on game state and remaining words
**Expected Impact**: Reduce average guesses by 0.2-0.4

**Request**: Code example showing how to dynamically select strategic words based on:
- Current game state
- Remaining possible answers
- Letter frequency analysis
- Position probability analysis

### **Lever 3: Smarter Endgame Strategy**
**Current**: Conservative endgame (only when ≤3 words remain)
**Opportunity**: More sophisticated endgame decision making
**Expected Impact**: Reduce average guesses by 0.1-0.2

**Request**: Code example showing when to:
- Guess the answer directly vs gather more information
- Use statistical analysis vs entropy analysis in endgame
- Implement look-ahead strategy for critical decisions

## 📊 **Current Algorithm Performance**

### **Guess Distribution Analysis:**
- 3 guesses: 16 games (16.0%) - **Target: 25%+**
- 4 guesses: 37 games (37.0%) - **Good**
- 5 guesses: 34 games (34.0%) - **Target: <30%**
- 6 guesses: 11 games (11.0%) - **Target: <10%**

### **Key Insight:**
To get from 4.36 to 3.66 average guesses, we need to:
1. **Increase 3-guess games** from 16% to 25%+ 
2. **Reduce 5+ guess games** from 45% to 35%

## 🔧 **Technical Constraints**

### **Performance Budget:**
- **Current**: 58.8ms per game
- **Available**: 91-141ms additional processing time
- **Strategy**: Use 2x more processing time for better decisions

### **Algorithm Structure:**
- **Current**: 250 candidates, 120 processed
- **Available**: Could process 300+ candidates, 200+ processed
- **Focus**: Quality over quantity - smarter analysis, not just more analysis

## 🎯 **Specific Code Examples Needed**

### **1. Dynamic First Guess Selection**
```rust
// Example of what we need:
fn get_optimal_first_guess(&self, word_list: &[String]) -> String {
    // Calculate entropy for each word against full word list
    // Return word with highest entropy
    // NOT hardcoded "TARES"
}
```

### **2. Dynamic Strategic Word Selection**
```rust
// Example of what we need:
fn get_dynamic_strategic_words(&self, remaining_words: &[String], game_state: &GameState) -> Vec<String> {
    // Analyze current game state
    // Select strategic words based on:
    // - Letter frequency in remaining words
    // - Position probability analysis
    // - Information gain potential
    // NOT fixed 75-word list
}
```

### **3. Smart Endgame Decision Making**
```rust
// Example of what we need:
fn should_guess_answer(&self, remaining_words: &[String], guess_count: usize) -> bool {
    // Decide when to guess vs gather more info
    // Consider:
    // - Number of remaining words
    // - Guess count remaining
    // - Statistical probability of success
    // - Information gain potential
}
```

2. **`current_ffi_service.dart`** - How we call the algorithm from Dart
3. **`current_game_service.dart`** - Game logic and state management
4. **`current_benchmark_test.dart`** - Performance testing framework

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

**Target Performance:**
- **Success Rate**: 99.8% (currently 97.0%)
- **Average Guesses**: 3.66 (currently 4.36)
- **Response Time**: <150ms (currently 58.8ms)

**Key Question**: How can we use our 2.4x performance headroom to make smarter decisions that reduce average guesses while maintaining 97%+ success rate?

## üéØ **CORE PRINCIPLES - NEVER COMPROMISE**

### **1. TDD (Test-Driven Development) - MANDATORY**
- **EVERY change MUST be test-driven**
- **Red-Green-Refactor cycle is MANDATORY**
- **Write tests FIRST, then implement**
- **All tests MUST pass before committing**
- **Test coverage is currently 787 tests - MAINTAIN THIS**

### **2. MINIMAL CODE - CRITICAL**
- **Remove unused code immediately**
- **Keep functions small and focused**
- **Eliminate duplication**
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**
- **Code should be self-documenting**

### **3. QUALITY OVER SPEED - NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- **Fix linter issues immediately**
- **Maintain 99%+ test success rate**
- **Performance benchmarks MUST be met**
- **Error handling is MANDATORY**

## üö® **CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR NEXT AGENT**

### **Why RustLib Should Still Exist**
- **RustLib is ESSENTIAL** - It's the core FFI interface between Dart and Rust
- **DO NOT REMOVE** - The new agent started changing this and it broke functionality
- **It's the bridge** between Dart and Rust code
- **All FFI calls** go through RustLib
- **Without it** - the app won't work

### **What NOT to Change**
- **RustLib** - Core FFI interface (DO NOT REMOVE)
- **FFI service** - Core service for Rust integration
- **Service locator** - Dependency injection system
- **Game logic** - Core game functionality
- **Test structure** - Comprehensive test suite

### **What TO Focus On**
- **Linter issues** - Systematic cleanup
- **Code quality** - Best practices
- **Performance** - Optimization
- **Documentation** - API documentation
- **Testing** - Test coverage maintenance

---

## üìã **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **MICRO-STEP 47: Fix public member API docs (405 issues)**
**Priority**: HIGH - Documentation quality
**Scope**: Add missing documentation for public APIs
**Files**: All lib/ files with public members
**Strategy**: 
1. Run `flutter analyze` to get specific issues
2. Focus on files with most issues first
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Test after each file
5. Commit with detailed message

### **MICRO-STEP 48: Fix prefer expression function bodies (113 issues)**
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Code style
**Scope**: Convert block functions to expression functions where appropriate
**Files**: All files with unnecessary block functions
**Strategy**:
1. Identify simple functions that can be converted
2. Convert to expression form
3. Test functionality
4. Commit changes

### **MICRO-STEP 49: Fix type annotate public APIs (72 issues)**
**Priority**: HIGH - Type safety
**Scope**: Add type annotations to public APIs
**Files**: All lib/ files with public APIs
**Strategy**:
1. Focus on public methods and properties
2. Add explicit type annotations
3. Ensure type safety
4. Test after changes
